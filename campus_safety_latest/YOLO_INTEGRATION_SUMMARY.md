## üîß Technical Implementation

### Safety Assessment Logic:
```
Safety Score = (
  lit_signs √ó 1.0 + 
  unlit_signs √ó 0.3 + 
  general_exits √ó 0.7
) / minimum_expected_signs

Levels:
- Safe: 80%+ (Green)
- Caution: 50-79% (Yellow) 
- Unsafe: <50% (Red)
```

### Model Configuration:
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.5
- **IoU Threshold**: 0.45
- **Input Size**: 640√ó640
- **Classes**: 3 (exit, lit_exit_sign, unlit_exit_sign)
- **Expected Model Size**: ~6.2MB
- **Expected Inference Time**: ~100ms on mobile
